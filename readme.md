User stories

1. user should be able to login to app and have option for app to “remember me” so they don’t have to keep logging in if they don’t want to.

2. user should have option to either “post” or “view” so they can either make a comment or just look at all other comments

3. if user wants to post, they will be able to click on 1 of 5 lines and that will select that specific line for then to comment on.

4. user will also be able to specify if they are going inbound or outbound in a drop down box

5. user will have option to say which car they are in, and input in a text box.

6. user will then be able to click submit and that will pre populate the comment field with the line, inbound/outbound/, optional cart, and a time stamp of when comment is being made.  the user will then be able to input a comment in the text field (If possible, they may also be able to add an emoji).  then they submit their post.

7. the user will then see a screen of all the users, comments, emojis, and comment time for that specific line, and will be able to scroll through.

8.  user will have option to “switch line” which will take the user back to the home page where they can either choose to “post” or “view” again.



In the process of making my app, I realized some of things that I wanted to do were just not practical for me to get done in time.  After finishing all the basic functionality of the app, I would have like to have been able to make my app so that the lines could be divided between inbound and outbound, you didnt have to see all the lines listed at the top.  I also wanted to have a button the said view, or comment.  I actually like that I did not do this.  I was able to make my app so that you could not comment unless you were logged in/created an account, I think it flowed much better this way.  The main thing I wanted to do to the app was to be able to see the most recent comments at the top, so a user wouldnt have to scroll down.  I under estimated how difficult this functionality would be for my app, and was not able to figure out how to do it in time.
